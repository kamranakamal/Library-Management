## Version 1.0.10 (2025-07-17) - Subscription Logic & Data Integrity Fixes

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Enhanced Error Messages**: More specific error messages for different types of subscription conflicts
- **Helper Methods**: Added `get_seat()` and `get_timeslot()` methods to Subscription model

### Files Modified
- `models/subscription.py`: Subscription overlap validation logic and helper methods
- `utils/excel_exporter.py`: Export queries with proper student active status filtering
- `models/seat.py`: Seat occupancy queries with deleted student filtering

    - Multiple seats in different timeslots (simultaneous)
    - Sequential subscriptions on the same seat (non-overlapping)
    - Different seats in different timeslots for different time periods
