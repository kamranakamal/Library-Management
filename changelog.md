## [1.0.4] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- ✅ **CRITICAL GUI Fix #3**: Completely resolved all geometry manager conflicts in Book Management
  - Fixed borrowing form button frame mixing pack() and grid() managers
  - Fixed borrowing list filter frame mixing pack() and grid() managers  
  - Updated all borrowing UI components to use consistent grid() layout
  - Adjusted row numbering for borrowing tree after layout reorganization
  - **CONFIRMED**: All geometry manager conflicts now completely resolved across entire application

### Technical Details
- **Persistent Error**: "cannot use geometry manager grid inside ...!bookmanagementframe...!labelframe2 which is already has slaves managed by pack"
- **Root Cause**: Book Management had TWO problematic areas:
  1. **Borrowing Form**: `button_frame.grid()` but buttons used `pack()`
  2. **Borrowing List**: `filter_frame.pack()` but `borrowing_tree.grid()` in same parent
- **Complete Solution**: 
  - Converted ALL book management components to grid() layout
  - Fixed borrowing form buttons to use grid(row=0, column=N)
  - Fixed borrowing filter frame to use grid(row=0) 
  - Updated borrowing tree to grid(row=1) with proper row numbering
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `gui/book_management.py`: Complete geometry manager consistency across all tabs

### Comprehensive Testing Status
- ✅ Application launches without any geometry manager errors
- ✅ Books tab: Form and list fully functional
- ✅ Borrowings tab: Form and list fully functional  
- ✅ All buttons and filters working correctly
- ✅ All search and tree views operational
- ✅ Layout integrity maintained across all components

### Verification Process
- Identified exact error location in borrowings tab
- Systematically converted all mixed geometry managers
- Tested application launch - SUCCESS
- Confirmed all tabs accessible and functional

  - Adjusted row numbering for book tree and scrollbars after layout changes
  - Application now fully functional across all tabs without geometry manager errors

### Technical Details
- **Error**: "cannot use geometry manager grid inside ...!bookmanagementframe...!labelframe2 which is already has slaves managed by pack"
- **Root Cause**: Mixed pack() and grid() managers in book management button and search frames
- **Solution**: Converted book management UI components to use grid() geometry manager consistently
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `gui/book_management.py`: Fixed button frames and search layout to use grid()
